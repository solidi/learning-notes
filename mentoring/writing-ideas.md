# Writing Ideas

## Principle

Not comprehension, but clarity.

## List
1. What is an Engineering Manager Anyway?
  - Managers keep train on time. Leaders show here to there.
  - Ruthlessly delegate and paint the picture of done.
  - Results, alignment, and hiring.
  - Not a promotion, a different discipline. First make it work, then make it right, finally make it fast.
  - Mentorship, sponsorship (advocacy) and initiatives.
  - Admin work, project management, disciplines.
  - The brutality are the lengthy feedback loops.
  - Organizational continuity.
  - Organizational and meta engineering. Build the machine that builds the machine. Higher order.
  - Knowledge, org, relationship power.
  - Fairness, impact to other lives.
  - Search & Sourcing: Investor attitude and pointing those to resources books, podcasts, etc. - highest bandwidth conversation.
  - Trying to stay technical is futile, invest in meta and reading.
  - COPs, COAs, and the three powers, partnerships.
  - Stews, optionality, and sleepless nights.
  - Trust, respect, having their back.
  - Systems and identity of a great manager.
  - No surprises.
  - Learning and mistakes.
  - Forcing functions catalyst.
  - The final frontier are people and soft skills.
  - Ender: all the books and the followers.
