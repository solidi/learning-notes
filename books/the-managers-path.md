# The Managers Path
## Author: Camille Fournier

## General Themes
- Good to have context on a person when they need a break.
- Assign stretch projects.
- Asking for advice from a boss is a good way to build trust and respect.
- Hiring summer interns is a good way to bridge the gap on hiring talent later.
- Attitude will determine the success of failure. Adopt a mindset of network building and worthwhile investment of your time and energy.
- Watch out from alpha geeks who hide and know more. This can make a team less effective.
- Work of breaking down a system is the same as architecture and designing systems and learning this skill is valuable even for engineers who don't want to manage people.
- Avoid surprises in 1:1s.
- Regular 1:1's are like oil changes. If you skip them you break down on the side of the road at the worst possible time.
- Limit your time working in usual timeframe.
- Middle of the road performers should be placed in an area where they can thrive.
- Create a safe environment where disagreements can take place. It's better than believing no disagreements exist.
- Don't promote jerks.
- Budget 20% time for learning and exploration.
- Pushing for more frequent releases reveals more interesting problems to solve.
- Lazy and impatient. 
- Manager is responsible for health and productivity of the team.
- Manager has to debug teams.
- Does your team understand the goals? Managers must align.
- Make sure not be become a go in between. Stay technical.
- CTO is a strategy job first. It's also a management job.
- Wanting to be CTO is like wanting to be married. Remember it's not just a title, it's also a company and the people matter
Try to bring solutions, not problems.
- Your presence as a big leaguer will change the tone of the meeting.
- Get curious and ask why to things. Don't just accept them.
- Advice to leaders: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures.
