## General Themes
- Ask the team what I am doing wrong.
- Rock stars are the rocks on the team.
- Management is forehand and leadership is backhand.
- Challenge directly, care personally, challenge directly == radical candor.
- Specific and through with praise as with criticism.
- Criticize three items before they can leave after first week.
- More praise than criticism - to give direction.
- Understand growth trajectory and if it's matches up with team.
- Uphold a quality bar.
- Don’t dump on a person all at once. Give them enough to be challenged.
- Teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.
- Strong opinions, weakly held.
- Big debate meetings.
- Two hour thinking blocks everyday.
- If something is correct, focus on work to prove it.
- Platinum rule: figure out what makes the other person comfortable, then do that.
- Good reaction to public criticism can be the very thing that establishes your credibility as a strong leader.
- If no one talks ask “So everything is perfect?” “If you can change one thing?”.
- Once we identify on what they want to learn, then its easy to identify opportunities.
- Require clean escalation, no backstabbing, and encourage guidance between team members.
