# Slack
## Author: Tom DeMarco

## General Themes
- Slack, less efficient and more effective.
- Managers main purpose is reinvention.
- Knowledge workers are not fungible. Treating them as such will increase busyness and harder for them to get useful work done.
- Bankruptcy of inventiveness, failure to set aside resources for invention.
- Result is stress when two mutually exclusive goal with no room for both.
- People under think pressure don't think faster.
- There is a thing such as a bad schedule. It’s a date that is set that is missed. That’s it.
- Overworked managers are doing things they shouldn't be doing.
- Good managers have a keen sense of how much their people are contributing.
- Second bad law of management: put yourself in as utility infielder.
- Good management is the corporate lifeline. Getting rid of it is like giving blood to lose weight.
- Star workers have good connections in the corporate environment. Their calls are returned faster.
- "Were lost but we are making good time".
- The more highly adapted the org is the less adaptable it is to any new change.
- Leadership is the ability to roll people into your agenda.
- Meaningful acts of leadership usually cause people to accept short term pain in order to increase the long-term benefit.
- The single must-be-present ingredient of successful organizational change is safety.
- In an unsafe environment people are not likely to let themselves be thrust into a position of inexperience.
- Reinvention takes place in the middle of the org, always.
- No such thing as healthy competition in the knowledge org. No one in isolation can work alone. At best, you have stochastic control on variables like salary etc
- We must move at prudent speed.
