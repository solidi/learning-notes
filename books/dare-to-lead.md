# Dare to Lead
## Author: Brene Brown

## General Notes
- Speaking is vulnerable. I don't memorize my lines or have a set shtick that I do verbatim. Effective speaking is about unpredictable and uncontrollable art of connection.
- I decided to find my way back to the world of leadership and organizational development. But this time, with a new focus: people, people, people.
- The courage to be vulnerable is not about winning or losing, it's about the courage to show up when you can't predict or control the outcome.
- The first hard and humbling lesson? Regardless of the complexity of the concepts, studying leadership is way easier than leading.
- I define a leader as anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.
- What stands in the way becomes the way.
- When we fix the wrong thing for the wrong reason, the same problems continue to surface. It's costly and demoralizing.
- Perfectionism and fear are keeping people from learning and growing.
- But what underlies all of them are deepy human issues.
- A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by commitment to lean into vulnerability, to stay curious and generous, to stick with the messy middle of problem identification and solving, to take a break and circle back when necessary, to be fearless in owning our parts, and, psychologist Harriet Lerner teaches, to listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard.
- The goal of this book is to give you language and specifics on tools, practices, and behaviors that are critical for building the muscle memory for living these concepts.
- Daring leaders must care for and be connected to the people they lead.
- Daring is saying "I know I will eventually fail, and I'm still all in." I've never met a brave person who hasn't known disappointment, failure, even heartbreak."
- If we shield ourselves from all feedback, we stop growing.
- We don't derive our strength from our rugged individualism, but rather from our collective ability to plan, communicate, and work together.
- Regardless of how we approach systemic vulnerability, once we try to strip uncertainly, risk, and emotional exposure from relational experience, we bankrupt courage by definition.
