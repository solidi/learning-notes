## General Quotes

### Chapter 1: It all starts with a sense of urgency
- Single biggest error people make when they try to change? They did not create high enough sense of urgency among enough people to set the stage for making a challenging leap into some new direction.
- At the very beginning of any effort to make changes of any magnitude, if sense of urgency is not high enough and complacency is not low enough, everything else becomes so much more difficult.
- The difficulties add up to produce failure, pain, disappointment, and that distressing 70 percent figure.
- Mistaking what you might call false urgency is a huge problem today.
- Why complacent and arrogant? Too much success in the past.
- True urgency is driven by a deep determination to win, not anxiety about losing.
- With an attitude of true urgency, you try to accomplish something important each day, never leaving yourself with a heart-attack-producing task of running one thousand miles in the last week of the race.
- People who are determined to move and win, now, simply do not waste time or add stress by engaging in irrelevant or business-as-usual activities.
- Never letting up After initial successes, groups with true sense of urgency refuse to let their organizations slide back into a comofortable complacency. They expand the effort, working on every phrase of the challenge, and never let up until a vision is a reality.

### Chapter 2: Complacency and false urgency
- Almost always, complacent individuals do not view themselves ass complacent. They see themselves as behaving quite rationally, given the circumstances.
- They would have both seen the problem and tried to solve it--despite political, cultural, or bureaucratic barriers. That's what a sense of urgency does.
- The solution to the urgency problem often starts with one person. It could be the CEO. It could be a Caroline. Whichever the case, the person does see the complacency, does see the false urgency, and is willing to act. We need many more of these people.
