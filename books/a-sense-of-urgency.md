# A Sense of Urgency
## Author: John Kotter
 
## General Quotes
- Single biggest error people make when they try to change? They did not create high enough sense of urgency among enough people to set the stage for making a challenging leap into some new direction.
- At the very beginning of any effort to make changes of any magnitude, if sense of urgency is not high enough and complacency is not low enough, everything else becomes so much more difficult.
- The difficulties add up to produce failure, pain, disappointment, and that distressing 70 percent figure.
- Mistaking what you might call false urgency is a huge problem today.
- Why complacent and arrogant? Too much success in the past.
- True urgency is driven by a deep determination to win, not anxiety about losing.
- With an attitude of true urgency, you try to accomplish something important each day, never leaving yourself with a heart-attack-producing task of running one thousand miles in the last week of the race.
- People who are determined to move and win, now, simply do not waste time or add stress by engaging in irrelevant or business-as-usual activities.
