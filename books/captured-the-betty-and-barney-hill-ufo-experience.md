## General Quotes
- Space pioneer Willy Levy had long ago written an interesting analysis of how an advanced being hould look--pretty much humaniod, with the head at the top (so as to spot the approach of enemies more quickly), two eyes to get 3-D imaging, two ears for binaural location skills, limbs for grasping, and so on. It seemed obvious, from looking at creatures on Earth, that there are favored arrangements. For example, few life forms seem to have three eyes, or three legs, or three ears.
- An accident with a grenade caused Barney to lose his teeth, necessitating dentures, and he was discharged in fair condition.
- As Betty sat in the passenger seat of her 1957 CHevy, Barney maneuvred south along the state's major north-south route, connecting New Hampshire's wilderness region to U.S. Interstate Highway 93 in Ashland.
- A dramatic UFO encounter in the White Mountains, NH." came to the attention of two IBM employees, Robert Hohmann and C.D. Jackson, when they joined Major Donald keyhoe for lunch at the XLL International Aeronautical Congress in Washington D.C.
- Dr. Simon's success rate was so high that his work was celebrated in the documentary movie Let There Be Light by John Huston.
- It is interesting to note that several research studies indicate that those who suffer from traumatic stress are more highly suggestible to somnambulism (the deepest level of trance) than the general public.
- As hyponosis.com puts it, "Each act of recall is a fresh creative process and not a memory retrieval of some fixed item from storage." When extraordinary memories seem to defy what is a commonly accepted as plausible, the individuals and the trained psychiatrist must rely upon their own experiences to determine the reality of the recall.
- Hynek founded the Center of UFO studies. He spent the remainder of his life engaged in the scientific investigation of UFOs.
- Skeptics contend that this part (amniocentesis) of Betty's exam came directly from the 1953 movie *Invaders from Mars*.
- The late David Baker, a prominent New Hampshire watercolor artist, was the first to bring precise forensic drawing of the alien's physical characteristics before the public.
- His authortiative behavior caused Betty to rethink her prior interpretation of the social structure of the group. She suspected that perhaps he was the real leader or the military representative, and the occupant she and Barney reffered to as the leader was actually an interpreter.
- *[The UFO Incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuOMMx-yIj8)*, a two-hour motion picture, was presented for the first time on NBC on October 20, 1975.
- Excited by another scientific interest in her UFO encounter, Betty agreed to meet with Fish in her Portsmouth, N.H., home on August 4-5, 1969.
- Many stars are also apart of a closely associated pair of stars, or even a triplet. It would appear that, because of the complicated gravitational field of two stars quite close to each other, stable planetary orbits, on a cosmic time scale, would nit exist near a doble or triple star system.
- The speed of light, which physicists often quote as 186,000 miles per second, in more useful units is about 670,000,000 miles per hours. The distance to the nearest star is about 4.3 light years.
- The planets of our solar system are also pretty much in a plane rather than scattered in all directions from the sun.
- Aliens finish the job that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus started in 1543 when he concluded that the Earth wasn't the center of the universe, the sun was.
- Sagan's insistence in the discussion of "reproducibility as the essense of science" was also way of the mark. Stanton pointed out that yes, reproducible, controllable experiments and observations- the first type of scientific activity - are certainly important. The second type is also science, when once can't reproduce , but can only predict certain events to the scientifically observed (such as eclipses).
- After Barney's death, Betty turned away from careful, objective evaluation, and with subjective enthusiasm began to identify any lights in the sky as UFO's. In the end, it destroyed her credibility, not because she didn't observe or photograph UFO's, but because she failed to heed John Fuller's warnings.
