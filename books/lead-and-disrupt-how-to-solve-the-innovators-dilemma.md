- "Why do successful firms find it so difficult to adapt in the face of change-to innovate?" The answer, we concluded, does not hinge on strategy or technology, or even luck-an important as these factors may be. Rather, it has everything to do with leadership-and how leaders act in the face of change.
- It requires that leaders have an understanding of both *what* to do and *how* to do it. It requires them to design organizations that can succeed in mature businesses where success comes from incremental improvement, close attention to customers, and rigorous execution and to simultaneously compete in emerging businesses where success requires speed, flexibility, and a tolerance for mistakes. We refer to this capability as *ambidexterity*-the ability to do both.
- They have built bridges to their next destinations as the footing under them was quaking. How were they able to do this? The short answer, which we elaborate on in the rest of the book, is that they had *ambidextrous leaders who were able and willing to exploit existing assets and capabilities in mature businesses and, when needed, reconfigure these to develop new strengths.
- How can we *exploit* existing assets and capabilities by getting more efficient *and* provide for sufficient *exploration* so that we are not rendered irrelevant by changes in markets and technologies?
- Innovation streams: 1. *incremental innovation 2. capability-destroying advance in technology 3. architectural innovations.
- Management is ensuring the trains run on time; leadership is about ensuring that they are heading to the right destination. Management is about execution; leadership is about strategy and change.
- The role of management in this world is to continually increase alignment among people, structure, and culture.
- Attaining alignment is the primary role of the manager-and it isn't easy. Setting up the systems and processes, structuring the work, motivating the people, and holding them accountable, and promoting constant improvement is a challenge.
- Short-term success is a function of alignment; that is, to execute the strategy, managers work hard at getting the right people, ensuring that the organization is structured the right way, that they are measuring and rewarding the right things, and that they are developing a culture that promotes behaviors to accomplish their key success factors.
- Today, managers may have only a few years to react before their companies are required to develop new capabilities or be pushed over the brink.
- Bezos's philosophy, has always been that Amazon doesn't make money when it sells things; it makes money when it helps customers make purchasing decisions.
- On Amazon: fact-based adversarial style (no PowerPoints allowed-only six-page narratives describing proposals and ideas.)
- At Amazon, "2-pizza teams"-groups that are small enough to be fed with two pizzas-have their own software developers, business-people, design staff, and so on.
- On Amazon: "Every time we hire someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool is always improving."
