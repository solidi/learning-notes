# Extreme Ownership
## Jocko Willink and Leif Babin

## General Notes
- "Relax, look around, make a call".
- A group of individuals is a team that has a mission.
- Must believe in the cause they are fighting for.
- The leader is truly and ultimately responsible for everything.
- "It pays to be a winner".
- There are no bad teams, there are only bad leaders.
- "It's not what you preach, but what you tolerate".
- "Extreme ownership, good leadership, is contagious".
- Zero responsibility for mistakes, “Tortured Genius”.
- Why are we being asked to do this? Leaders must take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture then come to a conclusion.
- Ask questions until you understand why so you can believe in what you are doing and you can pass that information down the chain.
- Ownership is everything! It's not his fault, it's yours.
- Cover and move is the basis of teamwork.
- "Engage with them", "Build a personal relationship with them".
- Improvement in performance did not come from process change or tech. It came through leadership principle that has been around for ages “Simple”
Prioritize and execute - "relax, look around, make a call".
- Do not let target fixation set in. maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed.
- Human beings are not capable in managing more than 6-10 people.
- Some leaders experience “battlefield aloofness”, they think they have control but they dont know whats happening.
- Junior leaders must know that their boss will back them up even if they make a decision that may not result in the best outcome.
- Make the time for analysis.
- Do the troops understand it? Everything else is bullshit.
- Tactical genius, match mistakes and discover aspects of the plan that need to be tightened up which enables you to look like a tactical genius just because you have a broader view (decentralized command).
- Everyone must understand the commander's intent (why + parameters).
- First, blame yourself. Examine what you can do to better convey the critical information for decisions to be made.
- When leading up the chain, use caution and respect.
- People do not follow robots.
- A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove (dichotomy - confident but not arrogant).
- Leadership is simple but not easy.
- That's how you lead people. You build relationships with them.
- Take the time to practice.
