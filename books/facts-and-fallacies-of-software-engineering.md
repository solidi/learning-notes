## Tips

### About Management
1. The most important factor in software work is the quality of the programmers.
2. The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers.
3. Adding people to a late project makes it later.
4. The working environment has a profound impact on productivity and quality.

### Tools and Techniques

5. Hype (about tools and techniques) is the plague on the house of software.
6. New tools and techniques cause an initial *loss* of productivity/quality.
7. Software developers talk a lot about tools, but seldom use them.

### Estimation
8. One of the two most common causes of runaway projects is poor estimation.
9. Software estimation usually occurs at the wrong time.
10. Software estimation is usually done by the wrong people.
11. Software estimates are rarely corrected as the project proceeds.
12. It is not surprising that software estimates are bad. But we live and die by them anyway.
13. There is a disconnect between software management and their programmers.
14. The answer to a feasibility study is almost always "yes."
