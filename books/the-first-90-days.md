## General Quotes
- The most dangerous transition can be the one you don't recognize is happening.
- Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it.
- You feel as you need to take action, you try too hard, too early to put your own stamp on the organization. You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives.
- Neglecting horizontal relationships - you spend too much time focused on vertical relationships and not enough on peers and other stakeholders.
- But your objective is not only to avoid vicious cycles; you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness.
