## Author: Michael Watkins

## General Quotes
- The most dangerous transition can be the one you don't recognize is happening.
- Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it.
- You feel as you need to take action, you try too hard, too early to put your own stamp on the organization. You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives.
- Neglecting horizontal relationships - you spend too much time focused on vertical relationships and not enough on peers and other stakeholders.
- But your objective is not only to avoid vicious cycles; you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness.
- Leadership is ultimately about influence and leverage. You are, after all, one person. To be successful, you need to mobilize the energy of many others in your organization.
- Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.
- In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to the break-even point more rapidly.
- **Build your team.** If you are inheriting a team, you need to evaluate, align, and mobilize its members.You likely also need to restructure it to better meet the demands of the situation.
- You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging.
- Decisions are shaped more by others' expert judgements and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support.
- Joining a new company is akin to an organ transplant--and you're the new organ. If you're not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected.
