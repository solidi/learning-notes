## General Quotes
- The most dangerous transition can be the one you don't recognize is happening.
- Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point. This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it.
- You feel as you need to take action, you try too hard, too early to put your own stamp on the organization. You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives.
- Neglecting horizontal relationships - you spend too much time focused on vertical relationships and not enough on peers and other stakeholders.
- But your objective is not only to avoid vicious cycles; you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness.
- Leadership is ultimately about influence and leverage. You are, after all, one person. To be successful, you need to mobilize the energy of many others in your organization.
- Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.
- In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to the break-even point more rapidly.
- **Build your team.** If you are inheriting a team, you need to evaluate, align, and mobilize its members.You likely also need to restructure it to better meet the demands of the situation.
- You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down into the details. This juggling act can be challenging.
- Decisions are shaped more by others' expert judgements and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support.
- Joining a new company is akin to an organ transplant--and you're the new organ. If you're not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected.
- Remember: you don't want to be meeting your neighbors for the first time in the middle of the night when your house is burning down.
- Likewise, every organization typically has a shared language--a long list of acronyms, for instance, describing business units, producers, processes, projects, and other elements of the company. So, it's essential that you invest early on in learning to speak like the locals. At this level, it's relatively easy for newcomers to figure out how to fit in. If people at your level don't wear plaid, then you shouldn't either, unless you're trying to signal an intention to change the culture.
- The risk, of course, is that you create an imbalance that leaves you vulnerable when success depends on being ambidextrous.
- Actively search out people in your organization whose skills are sharp in these areas, so that they can serve as a backstop for you and you can learn from them. A network of advisors and counselors can also help you move beyond your comfort zone.
- New challenges and associated fears of incompetence can set up a vicious cycle of denial and defensiveness. Put bluntly, you can decide to learn and adapt, or you can become brittle and fail. Your failure may be dramatic, like Julia's or it may be death by a thousand cuts, but it is inevitable.
- If you have been hired from the outside, ask for help in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders of finding a cultural interpreter. These people often are natural historians who can give you insight into how organization has evolved and changed.

* Accelerate Your Learning
    - The more efficiently and effectively you learn, the more quickly you will close the window of vulerability.
    - Remember: simply dipslaying a geuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.
    - Leaders who onboard into new organizations must therefore focus on learning and adapting to the new culture. Otherwise they risk suffering the organization equivlent of organ rejection syndrome (with the new leaders being the organs.)
    - He would have planned to engage in systematic learning process--creating a virtuous cycle of information gathering, analyzing, hypothesizing and testing.
    - In the political domain, you must understand the *shadow organization*--the informal set of processes and alliances that exist in the shadow of the formal structure and strongly influence how the work actually gets done.
    - Many leaders tend to dive in and start talking to people. You will pick up much soft information in this way, but it is not efficient.
    - Five questions to start 1:1's with
        1. What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)?
        1. Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?
        1. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
        1. What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities?
        1. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
    - Meet one-on-one with your direct reports and ask them the questions you compiled. You will learn about convergent and divergent views and about your reports as people.
    - There is much that bosses, peers, and even directs can do to accelerate your learning. However, to enlist their aid you need to be clear about what you're trying to do and how they can help.

* Match Strategy to Situtation
    - The first question is, what kind of change am I being called upon to lead? Only by answering this question will you know how to match your strategy to the situation. The second qestion is, what kind of change leader am I?
