## General Quotes
- "It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build."
- In the technology world, we generally have three stages of companies: startups, growth-stage, and enterprise companies.
- Strong tech-product companies know they need to ensure consistent product innovation. This means creating new value for their customers and for the business. Not just tweaking and optimizing existing products (referred to as value capture) but, rather, developing each product to reach its full potential.
- Leadership is likely frustrated, too, with the lack of innovation from product teams. All too often, they resort to acquisitions or creating separate "innovation centers" to incubate new businesses in a protected environment. Yet this rarely results in the innovation they're so desperate for.
- On roadmaps: First, they want us to work on the most important things first, and second, they want to be able to predict when things will be ready.
- The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work.
- The little secret in product is that the engineers are typically the best single source of innovation, yet, they are not even invited to the party in this process.
- Products are defined and designed collaboratively rather than sequentially.
- On Holistic product: And it can also include *offline* experiences as well that are essential to delivering the products value.
- Strong teams normally test many product ideas each week--on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week.
- Read the book *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries
- *Mercenaries* build whatever they are told to build. *Missionaries* are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers.
- I don't want to mislead you. All other things being equal, a co-located team is going to be *substantially outperform* a dispersed team. That's just the way it is.
- The honest truth is that the product manager needs to be among the strongest talent in the company.
- In product companies, it is critical that the product manager also be the product owner. If you split the roles into two people, some very common and predictable problems result--most commonly, the loss of your team's ability to innovate and consistently create new value for the business and your customers.
- Share challenges and problems very openly with the engineers. They will respect you more for it, and, in most cases, the developers will rise to the challenge.
- On principal product manager: This person should regularly review the work of the various product managers and product teams, identifying and helping to resolve conflicts.
- The CTO, managers, and architects are responsible for the holistic view of the system implementation. They should be reviewing the architecture and system design of all the software-both systems developed by your own staff, as well as any systems designed by vendors.
- Make sure the organization can rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly deliver quality products to market. There are serval measures of delivery, including consistency and frequency of release vehicles, and the quality/reliability of the delivered/launched software. The main obstacle to rapid delivery is technical debt.
- These delivery managers are typically also the Scrum Masters for the team (if they have that role). They are all about helping the team to get stuff live faster, not by cracking the whip but by removing obstacles that get in the way.
- On team structures and system architecture: First, the team feels like they are constantly fighting the architecture. Second, interdependencies between teams seem disproportionate. Third, and really because of the first two, things move slowly, and teams don't feel very empowered.
- As is so often the case with product, things boil down to a tradeoff--in this case between team's autonomy and leverage of the foundation.
- In some cases, product roadmaps come down from management (usually referred to as a *stakeholder-driven roadmap*) and sometimes the roadmap come from the product manager. They usually don't include little things like bugs and optimizations.
