## General Quotes

- For the lessons he taught me: respect competence, to value and defend freedom, and especially, that specialization is for insects.
- The Real Programmers typically came out of engineering or physics backgrounds. They were often amateur-radio hobbyists, wore white socks and polyester shirts and ties and thick glasses and coded in machine language and assembler and FORTRAN and half a dozen ancient languages now forgotten.
- In particular, the first version of the Jargon File (http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon} developed as a cross-net collaboation during 1973-1975. This slang dictionary became one of the culture’s defining documents. It was eventually published as The Acker’s Dictionary in 1983; that first version is out of print, but a revised and expanded version in *The New Hacker's Dictionary, MIT Press, 3rd edition 1996, ISBN 0-262-68092-0.
- Sadly, these prophets were without honor in their own company; so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place characterized by developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. Their influence on hackerdom was pervasive.
- Indeed, for more than a decade after its founding RMS’s Free Soft-Foundation would largely define the public ideology of the Hacker culture, and Stallman himself would be the only credible claimant to leadership of the tribe.
- Quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy but by the naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback from hundreds of users within days, creating a sort of rapid Darwinian election on the mutations introduced by developers. To the amazement of almost everyone, this worked quite well. then make a sustained argument from Linux experience for the proposition that "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”, suggest productive ilogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish nts, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.
- Linux overturned much of what I thought I knew. I had been preaching the Unix gospel of small tools, rapid prototyping, and evolutionary programming for years. But I also believed there was certain critical complexity above which a more centralized, a *priori* approach was required. I believed that the most important software (operating systems and really large tools like the Emacs programming editor) needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time.
- Every good work of software starts by scratch a developer's personal itch.
- Good programmers know what to write. Great know what to rewrite (and reuse).
- “Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow' (Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11)
- When you lose interest in a program, your last act is to hand it off to a compentent successor.
- Less formally, “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” I call this: “Linus’s Law”.
- Sociologists ago discovered that the averaged opinion of a mass of equally expert (or equally ignorant) observers is quite a bit more reliable a predictor than the opinion of a single randomly chosen server. They called this the Delphi effect. 
- Brooks (the author of The Mythical Man-Month') even made an off-hand observation related to Jeff’s: “The total cost of maintaining a widely used program is typically 40 percent or more of the of developing it. Surprisingly this cost is strongly affected by number of users. More users find more bugs.” [Emphasis added.]
