## General Quotes

### Chapter 1: Google, Meet OKRs
- Larry was an engineer's engineer, the son of a computer sceince pioneer. He was a soft-spoken nonconformist, a rebel with a 10x cause: to make the internet exponentially more relevant.
- For Google to have real impact, or even to reach liftoff, hey would have to learn to make tough choices and keep their team on track. Given their healthy appetite for risk, they'd need to pull the plug on loser--tofail fast.
- Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.
- OKRs is short for Objectives and Key Results. It is a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies, teams, and individuals.
- OKRs are not a silver bullet. They cannot subsitute for sound judgement, strong leadership, or a creative workplace culture.
- Objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented and ideally inspirational. When prperly designed and deployed, they're a vaccine against fuzzy--and fuzzy execution.
- OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire organization.
- (Influencing Andy Grove at Intel in 1968) - first, said Edwin Locke, "hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals "produce a higher level of output" than vaguely worded ones.
- In business, alienation isn't an abstract, philosophical problem; it saps the bottom line. More highly engaged work groups generate more profit and less attrition.
- An effective goal management system--an OKR system--links goals to the team's broader mission. It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to the circumstances.
- OKRs were an elastic, data-driven apparatus for freewheeling, data-worshipping enterprise. They promised transparency for a team that defaulted to open--they rewarded "good fails."
- OKRs are a survival tool. OKRs are a shared language for execution. They calrify expectations. They keep employees aligned, vertically, and horizontally.
- In Google's early years, Larry Page set aside two days per quarter to personally scruinize the OKRs for each and every software engineer.
- Many companies have a "rule of seven." Google flipped that rule to a minimum of seven. The higher the ratio, the flatter the org--which means less top-down oversight, greater frontline autonomy, and more fertile soil for the next breakthrough.
- OKRs drive clarity, accountability, and the uninhibited pursuit of greatness. Take it from Eric Schmidt, who credits OKRs with "changing the course of the company forever."
- Where OKRs take root, merit trumps seniority. Managers become coaches, mentors, and architects. Actions--and data--speak louder than words.

### Chapter 2: The Father of OKRs
- Fairchild was the industry gold standard, but it had one great flaw: a lack of "achievement orientation."
- The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can loo, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgements in it.
- Taylor and Ford: They held that the most efficient and profitable organization was authoriarian.
- Drucker: When people help cose a course of action, they are more likely to see it through.
- Grove wrestled with two riddles: How can we define and measure output by knowledge workers? And what can be done to increase it?
- A place where goals are transparent: I found it illuminating, a beacon of focus. And it was liberating, too. When people came to me mid-quarter, with requests to draft new data sheets, I felt I could say no without fear of reprercussion.
- The bestw way to solve a managment problem, he believed, wa through creative confrontation--by facing people bluntly, directly, and unapologetically.
- Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. When all goals are set top-down, motivation is corroded.
- OKRs are to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review. To encourage risk taking and prevent sandbagging. OKRs and bonsues are best kept separate.
