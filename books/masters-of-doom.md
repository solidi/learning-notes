# Masters of Doom
## Author: David Kushner
## General Quotes:
- "I think we can do that. That's still not a great amount of time, but we could probably do something decent, but I'm going to need a team: an artist, a couple of programmers, and a manager, because I don't want to sit there interfacing with management all day; I want to program."
- Like most artists and programmers, however, they enjoyed doing their craft more than cutting a deal.
- This death camp was id's version of a snuff film. They decided to include a screen at the beginning of the game that would say "this game is voluntarily rated PG-13: Profound Carnage." Though tongue-in-cheek, it was the first voluntary rating of a video game.
- "Everyone is expendable." Because of his technological innovations, Carmack remained the resident DUngeon master, the guy in charge, the one holding the rule book.
- "What was this?" Romero thought. It was like a match, like a boxing match, but the object wasn't just to knock the other guy out or some wimpy shit like that. This was, like, kill the guy! This was a match to the death. He stopped cold. "This," he said, "is deathmatch."
- For Doom, Carmack organized the data so players could replace sound and graphics in a nondestructive matter. He created a subsystem that separated the media data called WADs (an acronym suggested by Tom Hall, it stood for Where's All The Data?) from the main program. Everytime someone booted up the game, the program would look for the WAD file of sounds and images to load in. This way, someone could simply point the main program to a different WAD without damaging the original contents.
- The strippers were intrigued when they heard the guys made all the money selling deathmatch. Whatever that drug was, they figured, it must be some powerful stuff.
- From now on if people wanted to know the completion date of an id game, the reply was "When it's done!"
- The two top condenders - a stealthy Asian American teenager nicknamed Thresh and a FLoridian beach bum nicknamed Merlock - twitched over their PC's was they fought.
- So he decided to upload his work log, or, as it was known, a .plan file, to the internet. .plan files were often used by programmers to keep each other informed of their efforts but had yet to be exploited as a means of communicating with the masses.
- In addition to competing over the internet, gamers schellped their computers to each other's homes and wired them together into a local area network, LAN, so they could fight in person. These so-called LAN parties - which began casually with Doom - became the offline social nexus for the online gaming world.
- "Dude," Paul wrote to Romero, "don't fuck with me because I'll grab you by your ludicrously long hair and kick your ass back into the Doom days where you wish you were."
- "For any given project," he posted in his .plan file online, "there is some team size beyond which adding more people will actually cause things to take longer. This is due to the loss of efficiency from chopping up problems, communication overhead, and just plain entropy. It's even easier to reduce quality by adding people. I contend that the max programming team size for id is very small."
- The tension between Tim, American, and the other level designers had reached a boiling point. Adrian and Kevin were battling with Paul Steed. They disliked each other too strongly to work closely together on the mission pack, Carmack realized. The solution: build the next game around the company's animosity. Quake III would be a deathmatch-only title, using most of his ideas for the Trinity engine that would allow the map designers to work in complete isolation from each other.
- Her relationship with Carmack would last. They wed in Hawaii in front of a small crowd of family and friends. It was one of the only vacations Carmack had taken in his life. And, like the other times, he brought his laptop. There was work to be done.
