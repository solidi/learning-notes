# The Effective Manager
## Author: Mark Horstman

## General Quotes
- People aren't easily placed into neat conceptualized models that can be analyzed and measured. People are messy.
- The only thing that will change the results is to change what you do.
- An audience doesn't react to a speaker's nervousness. They react to the behaviors that they see and hear that they ascribe to nerves.
- Suppose Paul is not nervous, but he engages in all the behaviors that a nervous person engages in. What is the audience going to think? That he's nervous and not confident. At the executive level, that's the kiss of death.
- Your first responsibility is to deliver whatever results your organization expects from you.
- If not having these kinds of goals frustrates or worries you, perhaps you think that everyone else has clear goals. But don't worry. They probably don't either.
- If you can't list your goals almost off the top of your head, make a note somewhere to go to your boss in the near future. Ask her: "What results do you expect of me?" "What are the measures you've going to compare me against?" "What are the objective standards?" "What subjective things do you look at to round out your evaluation of me?"
- The four critical behaviors that an effective manager engages in to produce results and retain team members are the following:
1. Get to know your people.
1. Communicate about performance.
1. Ask for more.
1. Push work down.
- For the record, a manager can increase performance in the short term very effectively by using the power of his or her role as manager and threatening-and expecting-compliance. But if retention is thrown in as a required goal, the technique quickly sours.
- People and their behaviors are what deliver results to your organization (Not systems, not processes, not computers, not machines.) Results are your primary responsibility.
- What are the first names of all the children of the people who report directly to you? If you're like the roughly 95 percent of the managers we ask this question, you don;t know all of their names. A fair portion-maybe 40 percent-don't even know how many children all of their directs have! We call this, by the way, The Direct Relationship Acid Test.
- Most managers, however, have no idea how one sided their conversations are with their team members. They have no idea how little influence those brief conversations actually have on building relationships.
