- The only thing that will change the results is to change what you do.
- An audience doesn't react to a speaker's nervousness. They react to the behaviors that they see and hear that they ascribe to nerves.
- Suppose Paul is not nervous, but he engages in all the behaviors that a nervous person engages in. What is the audience going to think? That he's nervous and not confident. At the executive level, that's the kiss of death.
- Your first responsibility is to deliver whatever results your organization expects from you.
- If not having these kinds of goals frustrates or worries you, perhaps you think that everyone else has clear goals. But don't worry. They probably don't either.
