# Managing The Unmanageable
## Author: Mickey W. Mantle

## General Themes
- Managers must cultivate software engineering culture, built upon dev practices otherwise projects fail.
- Decide on core hours so there is a clear time to be in office.
- Avoid hiring cynics.
- The single most important thing a manager does is hire.
- Distributed team will never perform as well as a co-located one.
- Ownership, attention to detail, and follow through is very high.
- Understand the culture you are hiring for.
- Look for opportunities to make contributions.
- As a manager, you must communicate broad direction.
- Amazing things happen with 2-3 developers.
- When you land at a new company, pick a gnarly problem and solve it.
- Look for patterns of passion in engineers.
- The team needs to choose the tools they use.
- Slides should only drive home the points you are making.
- Be a leader not a follower in the cross functional activities.
- Being a good manager is not how quickly you can find the answer, but to mentor your staff so that they can.
- As a manager the people are the first priority, not product or profits.
- Nobody ever jumped ship without being on the rails first.
- Encourage innovation, you must encourage risk.
- If you encourage risk, you must tolerate failures.
- To tolerate failures, you must be patient.
- Expect commitment to making projects successful. Expect excellence.
