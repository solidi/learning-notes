## General Quotes
- I've seen the good: teams who band together to ship incredible user experiences that improve people's lives, or send a teammate flowers when they need to take time off to care for a loved one.
- Having a **shared language** about these atomic units is going to be necessary for understanding the rest of the book.
- Sometimes a team might be described as both a functional team and a feature team. A mobile platform team, for instance -- one created to support other feature teams as they integrate new features across mobile platforms -- might be made of engineers specializing in mobile development, making them a functional team. But since they also help make decisions about new features' implementations on each platform, and sometimes do the implementation themselves, they would also be a feature team.
- In 1965, psychology researcher Bruce Tuckman published "Tuckman's stages of group development" (http://bkpart.com/rm/00-01). These are the four stages a group goes through as it evolves from a bunch of strangers to a unified collective with common goals.
1. Forming
1. Storming
1. Norming
1. Performing
- These stages will repeat throughout the lifecycle of a team, even if you've been together for years.
- When a new person joins, or a manager changes, or the mission changes, these stages of group development can restart with those Forming stage feelings again. And since teams are in a constant state of change -- as you hire, as you switch projects, as you develop roadmaps -- you have an opportunity to address what's missing and how your teammates want to grow.
- As a manager, one of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on our team. This will be the underpinning of the team's overall health. To foster trust, you've gotta start by understanding each other: each person's needs, preferences, and approaches to work.
- To get to know your teammates as individuals, start from a place of genuine curiosity and authenticity.
- The **amygdala**: the part responsible for analyzing our environment for threats to our safety (or for rewards).
- Humans have six core needs in the workplace (BICEPS):
1. Belonging
1. Improvement/Progress
1. Choice
1. Equity/Fairness
1. Predictability
1. Significance
- I've seen the biggest displays of human emotion not around hiring or firing or organizational restructuring, but around desk moves.
- I usually keep a digital note labeled "First 1:1 Questions" for each person I manage, with their answers to these questions pinned at the top. (http://bkpart.com/rm/01-02)
- Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
1. New challenges
1. Low ego
1. Space to reflect and brainstorm
1. Timely and clear feedback
- "What's your favorite way to treat yourself?"
- He saw himself as an executor, rather than a strategy-setter or coach. He optimized for getting shit done, not for growing new leaders. Learning about his management style let us reset expectations, and then embark on a much healthier way of working together.
- During times of team scaling and organizational change, managers are responsible for things like strategy setting, aligning their teams work to company objectives, and unblocking the team as they ship their work.
- Managers wear four hats:
1. Mentoring - lending advice and helping to problem solve based on your own experience.
1. Coaching - asking open questions to help your teammate reflect and introspect, rather than sharing your own opinions or quickly problem solving.
1. Sponsoring - finding opportunities for your teammate to level up, take on new leadership roles, and get promoted.
1. Delivering feedback - observing behavior that is or isn't aligned to what the team needs to be doing and sharing those observations, along with praise or suggestions.
- Research has shown that "when women are collaborative and communal, they are not perceived as competent--but when they emphasize their competence, they're seen as cold and unlikeable, in a class double blind."
- But the best open questions are about the problem, not the solution. Questions that start with why tend to make the other person feel judged, and questions that with how tend to go into problem solving mode--both of which we want to avoid while in coaching mode.
- Practice your intonation to make sure your open questions are actually curious and open.
- Sponsorship is all about feeling on the hook for getting someone to the next level.
- While you wear the mentoring and coaching hats around your teammates, the sponsor hat is more often worn when they're not around, like when you are in a 1:1 with your manager, a sprint planning meeting, or another environment where someone's work might be recognized.
- Studies have found that when someone has a sponsor, they are way more likely to have access to career-launching work. They're also more likely to take actions that lead to even more growth and opportunities, like asking their manager for a stretch assignment or a raise.
- Opening the door for them to write blog posts, give company or conference talks, or contribute to open source work.
- Until I started learning about bias in the workplace, most of the people I sponsored were white, cisgendered women, like myself. Since then, I've actively worked to sponsor people of color and nonbinary people.
- When you give specific and actionable feedback to your teammates, it's smart to refer back to the language in their job description; this will help you ground your feedback in what's valued or required by your organization.
- The best feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered in a way that ensures the receiver can actually absorb it. As we know our amygdala will go into overdrive when it perceives a threat, and sometimes catching a whiff of incoming critical feedback can threaten any one of our core needs at work.
- A good question to ask might be "Can you help me understand what your optimizing for?" This way, I can gain some empathy with them, and they will pause to process what's going on for them in those moments.
- The first step should be taken by the person who has the feedback to share. Delivering specific and actionable feedback is a skill set that's necessary for each teammate to develop for you to grow a healthy, strong team.
- If there is no measurable negative impact, and no performance issues to manage, the coach the teammate who wants to give the feedback to introspect and develop a new perspective on it.
- Four major skills - **build trust**, **gain shared context**, **plan out and support career growth**, **solve problems**.
- I recommend at some point in your relationship--once you've built the foundation of trust--you should explain these four different skills, as well as when you'll choose one over another.
- As I mentioned earlier, some folks don't care about improving, and that's fine--right up until there's a cost to the team or the business.
- I've seen a handful of cases where a person performs poorly when they work with one manager, and is successful when they work with another; whether this is because of the first manager's approach, the team environment, or the switch itself, I can't be sure.
- I think it is worth documenting and iterating on are:
- Teammates' roles and responsibilities, including the manager's role.
- The team's vision and priorities.
- How teammates should be collaborating, communicating, and shipping work.
- Humans tend to benefit from increased clarity around what's expected of them in their job, and at their level in an organization; this clarity typically comes in the form of documentation like a career ladder, skills matrix, of job descriptions. These documents can also make it a lot easier for managers and leaders to assess folks' performance, deliver feedback, make a case for a hiring plan, write an public-facing job description, and so on.
- (On RACI) Naming some folks as Informed or Consulted can add clarity and reduce design by committee (And when you're in sponsorship mode, consider deputizing your sponsee as Accountable on a new project to give them a visible leadership opportunity.)
- These responsibility-articulating exercises--both a RACI matrix and a Venn diagram--can also illustrate where individuals might be currently overwhelmed with tasks, and provide a clear opportunity for others to step in and help. But the most important outcome of these exercises is that everyone on the team will have a shared understanding of who is doing what, and who they should go to for which kinds of questions or decisions.
- Companies usually have a high-level "north star" to inspire and align the work that gets done by individual teams. Many organizations also use goal-measuring systems like OKRs or KPIs to bake this high-level mission into day-to-day work and measure progress over time.
