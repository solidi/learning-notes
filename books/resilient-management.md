- Having a **shared language** about these atomic units is going to be necessary for understanding the rest of the book.
- Sometimes a team might be described as both a functional team and a feature team. A mobile platform team, for instance -- one created to support other feature teams as they integrate new features across mobile platforms -- might be made of engineers specializing in mobile development, making them a functional team. But since they also help make decisions about new features' implementations on each platform, and sometimes do the implementation themselves, they would also be a feature team.
- In 1965, psychology researcher Bruce Tuckman published "Tuckman's stages of group development" (http://bkpart.com/rm/00-01). These are the four stages a group goes through as it evolves from a bunch of strangers to a unified collective with common goals.
1. Forming
1. Storming

- As a manager, one of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on our team. This will be the underpinning of the team's overall health. To foster trust, you've gotta start by understanding each other: each person's needs, preferences, and approaches to work.
- To get to know your teammates as individuals, start from a place of genuine curiosity and authenticity.

1. Belonging

1. Predictability
1. Significance
- I've seen the biggest displays of human emotion not around hiring or firing or organizational restructuring, but around desk moves.
- I usually keep a digital note labeled "First 1:1 Questions" for each person I manage, with their answers to these questions pinned at the top. (http://bkpart.com/rm/01-02)
- Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?

1. Space to reflect and brainstorm
1. Timely and clear feedback

- During times of team scaling and organizational change, managers are responsible for things like strategy setting, aligning their teams work to company objectives, and unblocking the team as they ship their work.
- Managers wear four hats:
1. Mentoring - lending advice and helping to problem solve based on your own experience.
1. Coaching - asking open questions to help your teammate reflect and introspect, rather than sharing your own opinions or quickly problem solving.
1. Sponsoring - finding opportunities for your teammate to level up, take on new leadership roles, and get promoted.
1. Delivering feedback - observing behavior that is or isn't aligned to what the team needs to be doing and sharing those observations, along with praise or suggestions.
