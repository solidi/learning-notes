## INTRO
- Talk about years in software experience.
    - In New York
    - Highlight ic / manager, mobile/web.
    - Mobile to data intensive applications

        - anti-entropy
        - ask questions, meta, understand roles / retain and results
        - books (managers path, systems of engineering mgmt, making of a manager, etc)
        - metrics - delivery / accelerate / nps / etc

## TOP CAREER TIP
-  Every conversation, learning has potential to be a creative artifact for others to learn.
    - we learn from experiences - and the writing clarifies your approach.
    - Writing to an audience - Viacom.
    - TDD, team, and lately - understanding roles.
    - softwareleadweekly.com Oren Ellenbogen #380
    - Roles - and Yony Feng at Peleton.

    - "The one about blogging"
        https://medium.com/@solidi/the-one-about-blogging-cd9e65a2055b
    - philosophies on engineering, hiring.
    - nothing should be unaccounted for
- [Take a job you may fail at.]

## WORST CAREER MOMENT
- Being laid off, but ulimately becoming a better person
    - writing somethign now on it.
    - Convert the bad to good, process diagram and learning is a skillset with Dan.
    - Finding weakness, working the muscle to improve it.
    - Learned about engineering day books. Powerful, and reflect direction years later.
    - Stories at the tip of your tongue.

## CAREER HIGHLIGHT
- First, framing - finite or infinite hightlights - delivery is always finite
    - Growing two Tech leads - succession 
        - three attributes, technical, mentorship, and project management
            - time, people, quality, scope
- [Launching a product at nick - impact.]
- [Juniors/Interns - Growing others, and giving them room.]

## THE FUTURE OF CAREERS IN I.T
- Tools are primitive, will become more powerful, convo i heard from another podcast with martin kleppmann - Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
    - migration headaches, always.
    - order of magnitutdes - piping data from one system to another without effort.
- AI as a tooled sidecar - people may not understand its power yet.
    - pattern recognition and correctness, with decisive power
    - not about the what, but about the "how" better to outcomes.
        - Grammarly example.
- [Two things: Economy at scale, and engineering at scale.]
    - AWS, better tools.
- [Software is about people. Seen, heard, treated with kindness.]

## THE REVEAL

### What attracted you to IT?
- Being able to modify things, create things, in its own world.
    - TV story being a kid.
    - Half life and modifying things - side effects working with those remotely.
    - Website story in ihgh school - building a website to be heard.
    - The detail, and escapism of humans - but thats a paradox as software is a team sport.

### What’s the best career advice you received?
- Don't be so purpose driven.
    - Always driving to deliver, but there is more.
    - Connect with the team, lunch, people etc.
    - find their strengths.
- When things are burning around you, stay calm.

### What’s the worst career advice you received?
- Make things up.
    - The Veil - Comes from good intentions, typically - what was being said was priority.
    - same thing with code, respecting the effort of others past.
    - Don't judge immediately. Observe, observe, observe, then make a judgement.

### What would you do if you started your career now?
- Focus on the constraints others were in before me and recognize their accomplishments in their environment.
    - Horrible code quality wasn't horrible, it was a learnign artifact.
    - launch off of them for a better result.
- [Learning to be smooth in execution, worked with very senior leaders.]
    - Having a continuing conversation as the work ulimately is achieved.
- [Focus on the people and relationship building - technical will come.]

### What are your current career objectives?
- Continue a path on management, building generative engineering teams. ron westrum.
    - Building engineering leaders
    - showing others the meta

### What’s your number one non-technical skill?
- My sense of humor and playfulness with engineering humor. Understanding how to speak to an engineer. little things are important.
    - xkcd, commit strip, timely humor etc.
    - build respect effectively because we speak the same language.
    - "hit box story" how i bumped into a wall and blamed it on faulty hitboxes.

### How do you keep your own career energized?
- Focus on family, hobbies
- Proritize and execute
- Look to something that is interesting. "adjcent possible" - Stuart Kauffman 

### What do you do away from technology?
- My family, motorcycle and plastic modeling and F1.
    - Tutoring my daughter
    - Building things (tangibles)
- Quick story about my daugther and her on the management call.
    - proud

## FINAL CAREER TIP
- Ask for feedback; learn from others.
    - Its a gift, what got you here won't get you there - marshall goldsmith
- Chasing humanities - software is about people. 
    - Impact to others.
    - Story about a leader at IBM. Why wait until the end when you can share right now.
