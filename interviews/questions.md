## Tell me a time when you had to stretch to meet a team commitment?

### 2019
As an engineering manager, we have to fill gaps for the larger success of the teams we lead. Our most important action is hiring talent. At my position, a peer was tasked with hiring twelve new staff members. I noticed that my peer was saddled with this difficult task. I jumped in to help interview and split the process so that we shared the process together. This was not a requirement of my job; but due to the sensitivity of the timing, it was important. I assisted by building the hiring pipeline, and optimized the process as my peer lead the charge. We were successful. This built a solid relationship between the individual, and larger results came from that partnership including many successful hires for the team.
