# Plastic Modeling

Notes on the hobby and learnings.

## Principles

1. Buy two of the same kits. You are bound to lose pieces or make unrecoverable mistakes.
1. Never touch the model with bare hands. Use gloves so oils do not get on model.
1. Resist the temptation to touch the model unnecessarily. Excessive touching leads to breakage.
1. Less is more in any application. Except when thinning paint. Thin more.
1. Devil is in the detail. The more time you spend on detail, the more impactful the piece is.
1. Always use the right tool, and reserve that tool for its purpose.

## Techniques

1. Use a clip to hold the backing of the water slide decal when placing on the model.
1. Use hobby knife and decal softener to flatten bubbled/silvered dried decals.
1. When using light colors such as red over dark areas, use white as a base coat.
1. When brushing paint, brush over area once completely. Let dry and paint again.
1. Use a wax pencil to pick up small pieces to place and glue on model.
1. Drill small hole in back of part for ease placing on toothpick for painting.

## Rituals

1. Always replace the knife blade right before decaling.
1. Clean top of jar of paint before closing the lid.
1. Clean airbrush needle and pot well with q-tip after every use.
1. Build up a clear coat by a barrier coat first, then wet coats.
1. Use a bright light and an angle to see how the clear coat is being applied.

### Body Prep

1. Wash sprues in warm water with dish detergent and a splash of vinegar.
1. Sand body with 600 grit before priming.
1. Sand body with 3000 grit before base coat.
1. Wipe body with tack cloth and then body cleaner.

### Painting

1. Use white primer for light colors like yellow and and green.
1. Use pink primer for red.
1. Perform a barrier or tack coat before heavier coats.
1. A light coating of thinner after basecoat can help level the finish and make it shine.

### Clear Coat

1. Water down paint area before spraying to reduce dust.
1. Use a strong light source to see what is being sprayed.

### Interior

1. Use gray wash to accent black interior detail.

### Body Details

1. Use wash to fill panel lines. Do not go too heavy on the application.
1. Use naptha on a cotton swab perpendicular to the panel line to remove excess.
1. Use a marker to paint window trim after the final coat of paint is sprayed.
1. Use a marker and trace borders of lens to simulate rubber grommets.
1. Use motolow marker for chrome accents.

## Stripping Paint

If all else fails, you can strip the paint and start over.

1. Use oven cleaner to start.
1. The use brake fluid (DOT 3 or DOT 4) if oven cleaner fails.
1. Then use IPA/Tamiya lacquer thinner if brake fluid fails.

## Health and Safety

1. Always use respiration protection when using cleaners/alcohol.
1. Isopropyl alcohol fumes irritate the lungs.
1. Use fan to ventilate area by pointing out window.

## Learning From Problems

1. Fish eyes in paint occur from silicone on surface. Better surface prep is required.
1. Do not attempt to polish paint surface if more painting is required.
1. To avoid crazing lines, paint lacquers in thin layers.
1. For a smooth shine after a not so good coat, hit model with leveling thinner.

## Tips and Tricks

1. If brush does not touch extra thin glue, extend applicator.
1. Use a fiberglass pencil to erase pin injector marks.
1. Use a reverse tweezer to hold a small piece of foam sander.
1. Use extra thin glue to smooth out rough sanding spots.
