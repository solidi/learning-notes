# Plastic Modeling

Notes on the hobby and learnings.

## Principles

1. Buy two of the same kits. You are bound to lose pieces or make unrecoverable mistakes.
1. Never touch the model with bare hands. Use gloves so oils do not get on model.
1. Resist the temptation to touch the model unnecessarily. Excessive touching leads to breakage.

## Techniques

1. Use a clip to hold the backing of the water slide decal when placing on the model.
1. Use hobby knife and decal softener to flatten bubbled/silvered dried decals.
1. Use black marker and trace borders of lens to simulate rubber grommets.

## Rituals

1. Clean top of jar of paint before closing the lid.
1. Clean airbrush needle and pot well with q-tip after every use.
1. Build up a clear coat by a barrier coat first, then wet coats.
1. Use a bright light and an angle to see how the clear coat is being applied.

### Body Prep

1. Sand body with 600 grit before priming.
1. Sand body with 3000 grit before base coat.

## Learning From Problems

1. Always use respiration protection when using cleaners/alcohol.
1. Isopropyl alcohol fumes irritate the lungs.
1. Fish eyes in paint occur from silicone on surface. Better surface prep is required.
1. Do not attempt to polish paint surface if more painting is required.
1. To avoid crazing lines, paint lacquers in thin layers.
