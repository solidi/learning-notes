# Plastic Modeling

Notes on the hobby and learnings.

## Principles

1. Patience is everything.
1. Surface preparation is also everything.
1. Buy two of the same kits. You are bound to lose pieces or make unrecoverable mistakes.
1. Never touch the model with bare hands. Use gloves, so oils do not get on the model.
1. Resist the temptation to touch the model unnecessarily. Excessive touching leads to breakage.
1. Less is more in any application. Except when thinning paint. Thin more.
1. Devil is in the detail. The more time you spend on detail, the more impactful the piece is.
1. Always use the right tool, and reserve that tool for its purpose.
1. Before applying, experiment on a similar test mule to learn about the outcome.

## Laws

* The Law of Least Touch
    - With each touch of the model, whether it be by hand or by a tool, errors and defects increase.
* The Law of Imperfect Application
    - Applications of detail that are considered imperfect are, at best perfect.
* The Law of Diminished Finish
    - As the model subject draws to a close, more and more detail is observed to be absent on the model.
* The Law of Preparation
    - The more preparation is invested in a model, the better its result, but the fewer models are completed. And completion is the most crucial concept in modeling to capture satisfaction.
* The Law of Concealment
    - The camera hides minor issues with the build. This can be imperfections with the clear coat, or angles simply not shown.

## Techniques

1. Use a clip to hold the backing of the water slide decal when placing on the model.
1. Use hobby knife and decal softener to flatten bubbled/silvered dried decals.
1. When using light colors such as red over dark areas, use white as a base coat.
1. When brushing paint, brush over the area once wholly. Let dry and paint again.
1. Use a wax pencil to pick up small pieces to place and glue on the model.
1. Drill a small hole in the back of part for ease, putting on a toothpick for painting.

## Rituals

1. Always replace the knife blade right before decaling.
1. Clean top of the jar of paint before closing the lid.
1. Clean airbrush needle and pot well with q-tip after every use.
1. Build up a clear coat by a barrier coat first, then wet coats.
1. Use a bright light and an angle to see how the clear coat is being applied.

### Body Prep

1. Wash sprues in warm water with dish detergent and a splash of vinegar.
1. Sand body with 600 grit before priming.
1. Sand body with 3000 grit before base coat.
1. Wet sand body with 3600 grit before clear coating. Sand in one direction.
1. Wipe body with a tack cloth and then body cleaner.

### Painting

1. Use a white primer for light colors like yellow and green.
    1. Use gray primer first, then white primer on bright base plastic colors such as orange.
1. Use a pink primer for red.
1. Perform a barrier or tack coat before heavier coats.
1. A light coating of thinner after basecoat can help level the finish and make it shine.
1. To build excellent gloss on focus areas, first coat edges, and then the larger surfaces last.

### Clear Coat

1. Water down paint area before spraying to reduce dust.
1. Use a strong light source to see what is being sprayed.
1. After clear-coat, use 8000 then 12000 micromeshes. Finally, use polish.

### Interior

1. Use gray wash to accent black interior detail.

### Body Details

1. Use wash to fill panel lines. Do not go too heavy on the application.
1. Use naptha on a cotton swab perpendicular to the panel line to remove excess.
1. Use a marker to paint window trim after the final coat of paint is sprayed.
1. Use a marker and trace borders of the lens to simulate rubber grommets.
1. Use motolow marker for chrome accents.

### Decals

1. Use a coffee cup warmer plate to keep water room temperature while decaling.
1. Always use a new/sharp blade to cut out decals.
1. Tamiya TS-13 is too hot for water slide decals. Do not apply directly over.
1. Use a sharp knife to cut away more clear border around the decal before dipping into the water.

## Stripping Paint

If all else fails, you can strip the paint and start over.

1. Use oven cleaner to start.
1. The use of brake fluid (DOT 3 or DOT 4) if the oven cleaner fails.
1. Then use IPA/Tamiya lacquer thinner if brake fluid fails.

## Health and Safety

1. Always use respiration protection when using cleaners/alcohol.
1. Always use gloves when handling paints or thinners.
1. Isopropyl alcohol fumes irritate the lungs.
1. Use fans to ventilate the area by pointing out the window.

## Learning From Problems

1. Fish eyes in paint occur from silicone on the surface. Better surface prep is required.
1. Do not attempt to polish the paint surface if more painting is required.
1. To avoid crazing lines, paint lacquers in thin layers.
1. For a smooth shine after a not so good coat, hit the model with leveling thinner.
1. Metal details can break down from brake cleaner.
1. Using plastic cement on clear-coated gaps will peel the coat.
1. Clear coat will "pop" and highlight dark paint - be careful on marker touch up - it will show.

## Tips and Tricks

1. If the brush does not touch extra thin glue, extend the applicator.
1. Use a fiberglass pencil to erase pin injector marks.
1. Use a reverse tweezer to hold a small piece of foam sander.
1. Use extra thin glue to smooth out rough sanding spots.
1. Use a drill and long socket to sand wheels effectively.

## Tools

1. Use a jewelry wax pencil to pick up and place small items onto the model.

## Full Technique

1. Soak all spures, including clear parts, in dish soap overnight. Rise next morning.
1. Dry-fit pieces by taping or tacking pieces together to understand the fit and finish of the model.
1. Aseemble and glue body parts so that it can be painted.
    1. Focus on sub-assembly areas of body, chassis, and interior.
1. Find ways to increase fidelity by drilling holes in exhausts, body work, vents, head rests, etc.
