# Plastic Airplane Modeling

## Techniques

1. Pre-shading: Washing panel lines with enamel prior to the base coat for shadow effect.
1. Post-shading: Using highlight and shadow paint in areas of the model that adds realistic depth to the model.
1. Black-basing: Using a black base as a camo base before adding the lighter color.

## Principles

1. Weathering is welcomed when modeling airplanes. It adds realism to the model, as no airplane is 100% clean.
1. "Airbrushing is an art of brinkmanship."
